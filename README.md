## Description
This application makes it easy to display the Android device's screen on your personal computer. Just follow a simple set of instructions to allow the screen mirroring and by clicking on a single button you would be able to visualize the mobile device's screen on the desktop one.
The app not only shows the connected gadget but also allows you to control it on the desktop with the mouse and keyboard.

Under the hood, it is a simple UI wrapper over [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy). 
The app provides a user interface to make it easier for people not familiar with the process of running the commands through the terminal to be able to mirror the mobile device screen on their desktop.
When the user clicks on the button to mirror the screen the `scrcpy` process is executed.
